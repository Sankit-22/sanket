    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer1">
       Athletes may have illnesses or conditions that require them to take medications or undergo procedures. If the medication or method an athlete is required to use to treat an illness or condition is prohibited as per the World Anti-Doping Agency’s (WADA) <b> Prohibited List</b> , a TUE may give that athlete the authorization to use that substance or method while competing without invoking an anti-doping rule violation (ADRV) and applicable sanction. Applications for TUEs are evaluated by a panel of physicians the TUE Committee (TUEC).

NADA TUEs are only valid for national-level Competition and Out-of-Competition Testing.</pre>

      All of the four following criteria must be met (for more details, please refer to  <button onclick="window.location.href='FAQ1.pdf';" class="bold" style="color: rgb(255, 90, 90);"> the WADA International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions (ISTUE) Article 4.2):  </button>
      <ul>
        <li>The athlete has a clear diagnosed medical condition, which requires treatment using a prohibited substance or method;</li>
          <li> The therapeutic use of the substance will not, on the balance of probabilities, produce significant enhancement of performance beyond the athlete’s normal state of health;</li>
            <li> The prohibited substance or method is an indicated treatment for the medical condition, and there is no reasonable permitted therapeutic alternative;</li>
              <li>The necessity to use that substance or method is not the consequence of the prior use (without a TUE), of a substance or method which was prohibited at the time of use.</li>

      3. WHO SHOULD APPLY FOR A TUE? WHERE AND WHEN TO APPLY?
        <span id="icon3">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer3">
     <b> If it is determined that you are a National-Level Athlete  </b>i.e. the following Athletes who are considered to be National-Level Athletes:
     <ul>
      <li>Athletes who are members or license-holders of any National Federation in India, or of any member or affiliate organization of any National Federation in India (including any clubs, teams, associations, or leagues);</li>
        <li>Athletes who participate or compete in any Events, Competitions, and other activities organized, recognized or hosted by any National Federation in India, or by any member or affiliate organization of any National Federation in India (including any clubs, teams, associations or leagues), or the Government of India, wherever held;</li>
          <li>Athletes who, by virtue of an accreditation, a license or any other contractual arrangement, fall within the competence of any National Federation in India, or of any member or affiliate organization of any National Federation in India (including any clubs, teams, associations or leagues), for purposes of anti-doping; and</li>
            <li>Athletes who participate in any activity organized, recognized or hosted by the organizer of a National Event or any other national league and which are not otherwise affiliated with a National Federation.</li>
              <li>Athletes who are subject to anti-doping rules would need a TUE to take a prohibited substance or use a prohibited method. You should verify with NADA India to know to whom you need to apply and if you can apply retroactively.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>First, check if the required medication or method you intend to take or use is prohibited as per the WADA Prohibited List.</p>
    <button><a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/world-anti-doping-code-and-international-standards/prohibited-list" class="button">Prohibited List</a></button> <br><br>

    <p>You have a responsibility to inform your physician(s) that you are an Athlete bound to anti-doping rules. You and your physician(s) should check the Prohibited List for whatever substance/method you are prescribed. If the substance/method is prohibited, discuss non-prohibited alternatives, if there are none, apply for a TUE. Remember athletes have the ultimate responsibility. Contact NADA India if you are having difficulties.

      <br><br> Then, contact NADA India to determine your competition level and TUE application requirements.</p>

    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(4)">
      4. CAN I GET A RETROACTIVE TUE?
        <span id="icon4">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer4">
      You may only apply retroactively for a TUE to NADA India if:
    <ul> 
      <li>You required emergency or urgent treatment of a medical condition.</li>
        <li>There was insufficient time, opportunity or other exceptional circumstances that prevented you from submitting the TUE application, or having it evaluated, before getting tested.</li>
          <li>As per our anti-doping rules (NADA ADR 2021) you were not permitted or required to apply in advance for a TUE.</li>
            <li>You are a lower level athlete who is not under the jurisdiction of an International Federation or National Anti-Doping Organization and were tested.</li>
              <li>You tested positive after using a substance Out-of-Competition that was only prohibited In-Competition (for example glucocorticoids).</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <b> In rare and exceptional circumstances and notwithstanding any other provision in the ISTUE, </b> you may apply for and be granted retroactive approval for a therapeutic use of a prohibited substance or method, if considering the purpose of the Code, it would be manifestly unfair not to grant a retroactive TUE. <br><br>

      This unique retroactive TUE will only be granted with the prior approval of WADA (and WADA may in its absolute discretion agree with or reject the NADA India’s decision).
       <br> <br>
      <b> Important note:</b>
      <br><br>
      Using a prohibited substance or method without a TUE could result in an Anti-Doping Rule Violation.
      <br><br>
      In case an application for a retroactive TUE is necessary following sample collection, you are strongly advised to have a medical file prepared and ready to submit for evaluation.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Any TUE application that is not complete or legible will not be dealt with and will be returned for completion and re-submission. To assist you and your doctor in providing the correct medical documentation, we suggest consulting the WADA’s Checklists for TUE applications for guidance and support during the TUE application process, and Medical Information to Support the Decisions of TUECs for guidance on specific common medical conditions, treatments, substances, etc.
<br><br>
          Keep a complete copy of the TUE application form and all medical information submitted in support of your application, and proof that it has been sent.</p>

              Each TUE has a specific duration, at the end of which it expires automatically. Should you need to continue to use the prohibited substance or method, it is your responsibility to submit a new application for a TUE with updated medical information ahead of the expiry date, so that there is sufficient time for a decision to be made prior to the expiry of the current TUE.
<br><br>
             <b> Important note: </b>
              <br><br>
              The presence (following sample collection), use, possession or administration of the prohibited substance or method shall be consistent with the terms of your TUE. Therefore, if you require a materially different dosage, frequency, route or duration of administration, you should contact NADA India, as you may be required to apply for a new TUE. Some substances and dosages, e.g. insulin, are often modified during treatment and these possible fluctuations should be mentioned by the treating physician in the TUE application and would usually be accepted by the ADO TUEC.
